# rush
A shell implemented in Rust. Currently a personal project.

## Mission
Rush is a shell designed to be as user-friendly as possible, both for longtime users of other popular shells, as well as complete beginners who are just learning how to interact with their computer through the CLI. It largely aims to accomplish this by either modifying, replacing, or disposing of the largely archaic conventions of the traditionally-popular shells.

## Goals
- Support for easy coloration of input and output
- Powerful built-in commands with consistent structure and usage
- Out-of-box fuzzy finding, autocompletion, and command history
- Robust aliasing system for commands and executables
- Simple customization of shell visuals (prompt, coloration, etc) & debug/verbose output
- Straightforward interface to interact with/modify the PATH variable

## Development Updates
*Rush is currently looking for contributors!*
